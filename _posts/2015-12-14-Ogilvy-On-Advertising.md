Over the last few months, I have been zealously watching the TV show
*Mad Men*. It has given me a different perspective on advertising, a profession
which I previously looked down upon with disdain. I have come to realize that
advertising at its finest is no different than art: a method of associating
a material product with an instinct or an emotion. It is also a science:
the goal of advertising is to sell, and ultimately, consumer spending patterns
dictate the success of an advertisement, regardless of how creative it seems.

So, I turned to the voice of David Ogilvy, considered the father of modern
advertising and one of the founders of the agency Ogilvy & Mather. In his book
*[Ogilvy on Advertising](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EMXBZKA/)*, he
provides a unique and qualified perspective on being successful in the field
in various positions and through various media; the book includes countless
examples of ads that have been run throughout history. However, I was pleasantly
surprised to find that **his advice applies not just to advertising, but to
design, HCI, the tech industry---any field where you must connect with and
satisfy the needs of a consumer or user.** Furthermore, Ogilvy is ruthless
about using research to make sure that his advertising affects the bottom line
of the client, the equivalent of making data-driven decisions at tech companies
today. He even discusses the use of a precursor to the modern A/B testing called
*split-run*, invented by Richard Stanton.

Ogilvy's book can roughly be broken down into a few sections:

* An introduction to the different cogs in the well-oiled machine that is
the world of advertising (Chapters 1-8).
Ogilvy lays down his basic principles of advertising,
navigates the common positions in an advertising agency,
illustrates how to attract clients, and
enumerates tactics for success in both print and television.
* Advice on advertising in particular sectors (Chapters 9-13).
Ogilvy discusses advertising corporations and travel to consumers
as well as enterprise and philanthropic advertising. In particular, an
advertisement written by Ogilvy encouraging passengers of the New York subway
to donate money to the United Negro College Fund is one of the most poignant and
actionable pieces of short writing I have ever read.
He also spends a great deal of time discussing direct-response advertising,
whose modern equivalent is A/B testing with calls to action.
This has become so prevalent in our everyday interactions with the web that we
sometimes forget that we are the collective guinea pig of high-scale social
experiments.
* Reflections on the position of an agency in the commercial world (Chapters
14-16). In particular, he talks about taking on Proctor & Gamble, the Goliath of
consumer goods. Because of their consistency, they have achieve marked success;
however, this also makes their strategy quite predictable. He goes on to extoll
the values of research much like a modern-day tech company would praise
data-driven decision making. Lastly, he connects the roles of advertising and
marketing.
* Reflections on the place and responsibility of advertising in society
(Chapters 17-20). Ogilvy discusses the rising competition of agencies in foreign
countries (Ogilvy is himself British but made a name in the United States) and
six particularly influential figures in the history of advertising that were
deceased at the time of writing. He also touches upon a point which is still
frighteningly relevant today: **the lack of regulation in political advertising
as opposed to commercial advertising and the staggering amount of public deceit
henceforth** (Chapter 19). Lastly, he predicts 13 changes for the future of
advertising, some of which are poignant ("The quality of research will
improve, and this will generate a bigger corpus of knowledge"), and some of
which are horribly naive ("Billboards will be abolished").

I found this book *tremendously useful* in understanding how consumers think
and how to appeal to the human instinct of actionable impulse. I highly
recommend this to anyone interested in such human connections.

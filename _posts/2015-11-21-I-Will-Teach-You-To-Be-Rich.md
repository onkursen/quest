If you’ve known me for a while or even had so much as a dinner conversation with
me recently, you’ll probably know that I’ve become a bit of a
credit card/points/personal finance junkie. I’ve been trying to get my feet wet
a little more though, so I thought I’d read a book I’ve heard about for a long
time: *[I Will Teach You To Be Rich](http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-To-Rich/dp/0761147489)*
by Ramit Sethi.

I was on his email list for some time, and while I’m not the biggest fan of his
personality and judgment of people’s lifestyles, I do think Ramit has some sound
perspective on aiming for a “Rich Life” as is defined by each individual’s
standards. The book in general is divided into 3 macro parts consisting of about
3 chapters each:

1. Intro to the mechanisms of credit cards, bank accounts, and investment
accounts. This wasn’t particularly useful to me as I’ve already plunged deep
into these realm (and since this is where my obsession primarily lies).
2. A high-level view of financial planning for those three realms. The framewor
is presented clearly, and I was able to do a sanity check against it and pick
up a few lessons here and there. However, still nothing life-changing; most of
it was well-thought-out, simple advice that was stated clearly.
3. A more detailed overview of investing in particular accounts and planning for
the road ahead. This was the section that really spoke to me as I’ve been trying
to manage my retirement investments more actively and try out non-retirement
investments as well. It also gave me a wake-up call to start thinking/saving
about particular factors now that seem in the distant future (e.g., wedding,
house, life insurance).

Overall, the book was definitely worth the few hours I put into it. If you’re
new to personal finance, definitely check it out. If you’re already experienced,
still give the last section a go.

Also, if you’re at all interested in personal finance, let’s talk! Would love to
bounce ideas off people.

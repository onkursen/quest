I decided to take a break from nonfiction and pick up a novel; I ended up
devouring it in a few hours. There are two things that, without giving away any
plot details, really distinguished this book as a piece of writing:

1. The non-specific narration in the second person styled as a self-help book.
No names of characters or places are ever used!
2. The contrast in focus spent on the main character’s events. Life events
surrounding “you” and your family are skipped over between paragraphs, whereas a
single thought may be examined over multiple pages.

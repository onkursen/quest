In a world that's ruled by short, pithy forms of communications like tweets and articles, I'm pretty terrified of losing my ability to focus and consume long-form content.

So I'm starting my own personal summer reading challenge: one book a week with a concise mini-reflection of something that resonated with me. Please comment or message with any recommendations you have!

This week, after pre-ordering and eagerly awaiting its release, I obtained and finished reading *Modern Romance* by Aziz Ansari. One thing that really stood out was his observation that we find great comfort in our "phone world", which serves as a retreat that we can duck into when we don't want to interact in the physical world. I think almost everyone I know is guilty of this (myself included). If we just pulled our noses out of our phones and actually spent some time interacting with the people around us, imagine how much more connected we would both feel and actually be.

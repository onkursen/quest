I wanted to dig deeper into personal finance after the last read. In particular,
I wanted to know more about index funds and why despite their simplicity,
they’re so popular. So, I turned to none other than the creator of the first
index fund and founder of The Vanguard Group, John C. Bogle in his book
*[The Little Book of Common Sense Investing](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Common-Sense-Investing-ebook/dp/B008W02TIG/)* 
Using “the relentless rules of humble arithmetic” as well as countless opinions
from his financial peers (including Warren Buffett), Bogle provides a convincing
case for picking index funds based on the following observations:

- The returns of the stock market correspond to the performance of the
businesses represented by the stocks.
- The stock market is a zero-sum game. For every gain you make, someone else
loses an equal amount.
- You are probably not a skilled investor, and even if you think you are,
there’s no way to distinguish it from luck unless you have >90 years of
investing data (which is unlikely for any individual).

Therefore, any sort of “betting” on individual stocks or funds goes from a
zero-sum game to a loser’s game. It’s just like poker: the house always wins.
So if you can’t win by picking a handful of stocks, what do you do? You pick
*all of them* to maximize diversification and minimize risk. This is what an
index fund does--it passively tracks a pre-set collection of stocks called an
index (e.g., S&P 500) weighted by market capitalization that is representative
of the market at large.

The book mainly compares the performance of index funds with actively-managed
mutual funds. Through various astonishing and sometimes counter-intuitive
examples, the most boring and simplest index fund will outperform trusted
individual advisers and mutual funds managed by armies of financial advisers in
the long run. This is not only because the returns of index funds are higher,
but the associated costs are dramatically lower. A startling statistic I saw:
only 3 out of 355 mutual funds outperformed the Vanguard 500 index between 1980
and 2005! And even those returns were only marginally better. A big lesson I
learned is that **returns come and go, but costs are forever**.

The book also talks about other securities like bonds, which are lower in risk
than stocks and thus produce lower and more predictable returns. Even here, an
index fund performs well although marginally so. However, a big caution point
of the book was the rise of ETFs, which are a trading equivalent of index funds.
The thing to look out for is the associated costs; it’s much better in the long
term to buy and hold than to actively trade.

Bogle concludes the book with a nice summary of the lessons learned as well as
some practical advice you can immediately apply to your investments. If nothing
else, I would highly recommend reading this last chapter!

This book presents many other miscellaneous lessons, and while it does sometimes
alternate between an idealistic manifesto and a gory number-packed treatise, it
has definitely solidified the index fund as a cornerstone in my investing
strategy. I would highly recommend this to someone looking to understand
different investment options!

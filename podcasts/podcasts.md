**NPR Politics Podcast**  
[The Election of Donald Trump](https://overcast.fm/+FimJGHCkw)  
Notes:

* Trump has consistently generated controversy initially but then surged
  stronger.
* A consistent message from Trump supporters is that they think he should tone
  down his hateful rhetoric, but they do like that he represents a break from
  the establishment and a voice for change and empowerment.
* Obama signed various executive orders in his first 1-2 days, some of which
  repealed legislation that was passed by the Bush administration. It's likely
  that Trump will do the same.
* Democrats can filibuster Trump's Supreme Court nominations but cannot do
  the same for any members of his cabinet. This is a result of the Democratic
  party's motions in the past in anticipation of a Clinton presidency.
* Clinton got 37% of white voters (worse than Obama). Trump did better
  than Romney with Latino (29% vs 27%) and African-American voters.
  "Demographics are destiny."
* 40% of the electorate decided their vote in September or after. Trump won
  pretty much *all* of that vote whereas Clinton won most of the vote
  before September.
* Millennials are now the largest generation, and by the next election, they
  will comprise the largest component of the voting population.
* This election has exposed a lot of the polarization within the country that
  is hidden by the echo chamber effect of social media, but it may be a wake
  up call for people to confront other opinions and viewpoints. In particular,
  it's more likely that people with different viewpoints are for the most
  part are good, honest people.

**The Ricochet Podcast**  
[The First 100 Days](https://overcast.fm/+BIC217KqE)  
Notes:

* Louisiana had runoff elections that tilted in Republicans' favors.
* With Republican-controlled legislative and executive branches, there is the
  chance for the prolific passing of legislations, which may allow for
  unprecedented change and progress if Congress uses this power responsibly.
* Democrats had previously been contributing to the "erosion of the separation
  of powers", which was useful during the Obama presidency, but now works
  against their interests when Trump takes the office.
* Out of all the countries who sent representatives to the Kyoto accord,
  only the United States has reduced its emissions; the podcasts attribute
  this success to fracking.
* Lower tax rates not only provide a cash effect (Keynesian benefit), but also
  an incentive effect because each additional dollar earned is taxed less.
  This will theoretically allow corporations to reinvest more money into
  operations and stimulate growth. In the medium term, this may allow for the
  reduction of the budget deficit.
* The Atlantic has said Trump supporters take him *seriously* but not
  *literally* whereas his detractors take him *literally* but not *seriously*.
* It may actually be a *mistake* to take him at his word. The fact that he
  keep changes his public stance on any particular issue may be a negotiation
  tactic and campaign strategy.
* Trump began and ran his campaign with inflammatory rhetoric and is now
  slowly tempering it down; this is in contrast to what many political figures
  have done.
* The liberal assumption that Clinton would win also raised the question of
  what the future of the Republican party would be since it has been divided
  and re-defined in the course of this election cycle. However, given the
  reverse result, the Democratic party may actually be more threatened. In two
  years, the number of Republican senators running for re-election in a
  state that Clinton won: 1. The number of Democratic senators running for
  re-election in a state that Trump won: 10.
* Demographic changes are under way in moving away from the white majority
  (now plurality).

Observations:

* Interestingly, although this podcast is advertised to be expressed from a
  center-right perspective, the host and guests seem to be much more
  sympathetic to the left than people on more liberal politics podcasts (e.g.,
  NPR Politics Podcast) are sympathetic to the right. In fact, one of the
  hosts was a conservative but a staunch Trump opposer. Additionally, the host
  opens the podcast with some information about Ricochet's "The Daily Shot"
  newsletter and specifically appeals to those on the center-left to get some
  information on "what the other side is thinking". This to be sparks a more
  open and informed discourse, which I greatly appreciate.
* There was a *lot* of heavy economic policy that was discussed in this
  podcast. This may partially be because the main host works at the Stanford
  Hoover Institution, but the guest spoke in detail about Keynesian economics,
  stimulus spending, energy policy, and tax codes. This is much more detailed
  than the other political podcasts that I listen to, which is interesting
  because I didn't expect it to come from this source.
* More generally speaking, this podcast didn't provide any mention of racism,
  sexism, or other xenophobia; it was *entirely focused on policy*. In some
  sense, this makes me hopeful: it signals that people can analyze Trump
  from a right-leaning perspective without spewing the hateful positions
  that the left has come to associate with the candidate.
* The podcast host was very smooth in inserting advertisements throughout the
  podcast. Most other podcasts have very distinct ads from people in different
  voices who begin with a phrase like "This podcast is supported by..."
  whereas the host will actually shape the topic of conversation and shift it
  slowly until he finally delivers the ad smoothly. Masterful use of
  communication.


**The Axe Files with David Axelrod**  
[95 - Van Jones](https://overcast.fm/+FPeRiMp8s)  

Notes:

* There are two kinds of smart people
    1. Those that take simple things and make them sound complicated to
       impress people  
    2. Those that take complex things and make them sound simple to help
       people  

  Be the second kind of person.
* A big problem demonstrated in this election is that the "liberal
  imagination" doesn't have a place of honor for the straight white
  heterosexual man who votes Republican. They are somehow all the oppressor,
  the enemy, the other. Nobody checks in on those guys, but someone should
  have. And now people are mad that Trump has been elected because he did.
* "The moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice." But it
  only bends if people force it that way.

**The Art of Manliness**  
[#249: The Benefits of Pride](https://overcast.fm/+LoD9TJ10)  

Notes:
* There are two kinds of pride: authentic pride and hubristic pride.
* Authentic pride is essential to appearing human and developing self-esteem
  and resilience. It also helps in developing a style of leadership that is
  both authoritative and inclusive.
* Hubristic pride, on the other hand, is mainly self-serving and can alienate
  others.

**Dear Sugar**  
[When Your Loved Ones Just Don't "Get It"](https://overcast.fm/+D7pPyOfHU)  

Notes:
* If you feel isolated, even though people may not understand your pain, they
  can believe it and want to help in some way. It is your responsibility to
  reach out to them and let them know how they can do so.

### Nov 10 2016

**Marketplace**  
[For Thursday, November 10, 2016](https://overcast.fm/+JyIW6IZY)  

Notes:
* Trump plans to lower corporate tax rate to 15% (perhaps won't happen).
* Lisa Goldberg: Disappointed by the election result, but disappointment is a
part of being part of this world. The hard work lies ahead.
* Not following through on climate change agreements (viz. Paris) could pose
  a threat to the efficacy other nations who have been sanctioned.
* Tax question: should taxes be imposed where goods are produced or consumed?

**POLITICO's Pulse Check**  
[Obamacare is now endangered. But it’s not dead yet.](https://overcast.fm/+GfeLMKhqQ)  

Notes:
* Repealing Obamacare would affect 20 million people and could leave >17
  million people` uninsured for a significant period of time.
* Trump may run with a replacement plan Paul Ryan has drafted that has been
  vetted by conservatives. It includes a tax credit that acts as a voucher
  to low-income households to use for healthcare and is actually similar to
  the premium credits provided by the ACA.
* Obamacare has not been struck down yet, so hope is not lost. The fight lies
  ahead to reach across the aisle and work with both parties to try to achieve
  a compromise that can work for all Americans.


**NPR Politics Podcast**  
[Trump, Obama Meet at the White House](https://overcast.fm/+FimLqeYYM)  
Takeaways:
* This is the first time Trump and Obama have met in person. The meeting was
  supposed to last 10-15 minutes but lasted over 1.5 hours. They talked about
  the transition from one presidency to the next, and just as in his speech
  after Trump's election, Obama made it clear he wanted to allow a smooth,
  peaceful transition of power much like Bush did for him.
* Both men seemed to have an odd amount of respect for each other and were
  behaving differently from how they did in the campaign season. This is the
  difference between *politics* and *governing*.

**Code Switch**
[A Muslim and A Mexican Walk Into A Bar...](https://overcast.fm/+GjoguLOWI)  

Notes:
* 1/3 of the Latino voting population voted for Trump.
* There is the mythical notion of the "caudillo" where the white savior comes
  riding in on horseback. Many Latinos associate that image with Trump.
* The Latino population tends to blame any conservative shifts in thinking on
  Cubans who have settled in South Florida because they have historical
  precedent of espousing more conservative views.
* Doing a standup tour throughout Middle America and using humor from a Muslim
  background opened up people's minds and achieved more effective change and
  dialogue than shaming from far away.

**Planet Money**  
[#734: The Trump Indicators](https://overcast.fm/+BP58jq2M4)  

Notes:
* Futures dropped to 5% limit overnight after election because markets react
  poorly to surprises and instability.
* 1 USD = 20 pesos. Mexican currency has been reacting to Trump's reaction and
  threats to Mexico throughout the election cycle.
* Alan Cole critiqued Trump's tax plan and was able to change his mind
* "Schrodinger's tax cut": Trump has been inconsistent about his tax plans
